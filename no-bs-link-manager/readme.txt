A visual, no-nonsense link manager for WordPress. Bulk-edit, patch, and check all your site’s links—no paywall, no BS, ever.

== Description ==

**NO BS Link Manager** is for every WordPress user sick of “Pro” paywalls and SaaS nag screens just to manage links.  
See all your internal and external links in a single dashboard. Edit anchors, URLs, rel/nofollow, and more instantly.  
Zero features are locked. No email signup. Free forever, supported by donations and optional non-intrusive ads.

**What makes it different?**  
It’s built by a blue-collar hard working man who learned just enough code (and AI!) to solve his own headaches—and who refuses to make others pay for basic features.  
No premium, no tiers, no nags. If you pay, it’s a thank you, not a requirement.

**Features:**
- Instantly view all internal & external links across your site.
- Bulk search links by anchor or URL.
- Edit URLs, anchor text, rel attributes (nofollow, sponsored, UGC), and open-in-new-tab—all from one place.
- Link status checker—see 404, 301, and more for every link.
- Beautiful, readable dashboard. Clean, color-coded badges for attributes.
- Fully free. No feature is or will ever be behind a paywall.

**Why?**
Because if I paid for every plugin upsell, my family would be eating beans exclusively. If you feel the same, this is for you.

**How is it free?**
Supported by small ads and donations. You get everything—no “pro” upgrades, ever.

2. Activate the plugin through the ‘Plugins’ screen in WordPress.
3. Go to “NO BS Link Manager” in your WordPress admin menu.
4. Done! No setup, no keys, just start editing your links.
