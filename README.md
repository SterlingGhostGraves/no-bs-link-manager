**Free, visual WordPress link manager – edit all links, anchors, and attributes from one dashboard. No paywall. No SaaS. No nonsense.**

## Why This Plugin Exists

What happens when a blue collar worker, tired of paywalls and SaaS upsells for every little feature, decides to learn just enough coding to build their own solution? You get a WordPress plugin designed to do exactly what’s needed—without trying to nickel-and-dime you.

Every year, more WordPress plugins lock basic features behind subscriptions and email opt-ins. For people who just want to manage their site’s links without friction or cost, it’s a mess.

**No BS Link Manager** was built by someone who understands what it’s like to live paycheck to paycheck, who can’t throw $15/month at every "pro" feature, and who just wants honest, functional tools for real users.
